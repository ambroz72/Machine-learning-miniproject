# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository explores the feasibility of predicting Bitcoin prices using various machine learning techniques. 
It provides a framework for data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Project Goals

Investigate the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting Bitcoin price trends.
Identify the most suitable algorithms for this specific task.
Gain insights into factors that influence Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Data

The project utilizes historical Bitcoin price data, potentially from sources like:

Quandl [invalid URL removed]
CoinMarketCap
CryptoCompare
The data may include features such as:

Opening price
High price
Low price
Closing price
Trading volume
Market capitalization
Sentiment indicators (optional)
Methodology

Data Acquisition: Download historical Bitcoin price data from a chosen source.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and format the data, handle missing values, and scale features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to understand trends, patterns, and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering (optional): Create new features based on domain knowledge or feature selection techniques.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models, including:
Linear Regression (baseline)
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared (RÂ²).
Model Selection: Choose the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Prediction: Use the chosen model to make Bitcoin price predictions on unseen data.
Visualization: Visualize the actual vs. predicted prices to assess model accuracy.
Implementation

The project is implemented using Python libraries such as:

pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
TensorFlow (for LSTMs)
Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualization)
